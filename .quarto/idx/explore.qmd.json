How is the `Depressed` Variable defined?\n2. When was the data collected? \n3. How many missing values are there for the `Depressed` variable?\n4. How many missing values are there for `Depressed`?\n5. How many categories does `LittleInterest` have? What do they represent?\n6. Is there an association of `LittleInterest` with `Depressed`?\n7. Is marijuana use associated with depression?\n8. What is the oldest person in the dataset? Any idea why?\n9. How is sleep defined in the dataset?\n10. How are sleep and marijuana use related in the dataset?\n11. What is the most frequent number of sleep hours in the data?\n12. Is there a relationship between Sleep hours and depression?\n13. Is there a relationship between Sleep hours and Age?\n\n## Physical Activity Questions \n\n1. What is the percent missing for `PhysActive` (yes/no physically active)?\n2. What are the characteristics of people who have missing responses for `PhysActive`?\n3. How does missingness and responses in `PhysActive` relate to responses and missingness in `PhysActiveDays` and PhysActiveDaysAtLeast3? How does the proportion of missingness in `PhysActiveDaysAtLeast3` (yes = `PhysActiveDays`>= 3, no < 3) relate to `PhysActive` response? Is this what you would expect?\n4. Is there something strange about `Age`?\n5. What is the median and interquartile range of `PhysActiveDays`?\n6. Is number of sleep hours associated with physical activity? Consider using the categorized variable `SleepHrsNightCat`.\n7. What about levels of education?\n8. What about BMI? Is the association of BMI with physical activity dependent on which measure of activity you use -- `PhysActive` (yes/no) or `PhysActiveDaysAtLeast3`?\n9. Are there other covariates you expect to be associated with physical activity? How do they relate to each other?\n\n## Diabetes\n \n1. How is the variable Diabetes defined?\n1. What % of Diabetes responses/entries is missing? What % of DiabetesAge is missing? How do you explain this?\n1. How common is DM in men of the study group? How common in women?\n1. How common is DM in different BMI groups?\n1. Is DM more common in those who are physically active or who are not?\n1. Is diabetes more common among smokers or non-smokers?\n1. Do the TV watching habits differ between those with and without diabetes? What about physical activity? How confident are you in each of these conclusions?\n1. What is the most common age when diabetes is diagnosed? How about young children < 5 years old?\n1. Is diabetes more a disease of youth or of age?\n1. Who has higher blood pressure (on average) – those with or without diabetes?\n1. What is the median age of those with diabetes and obesity = BMI > 30? (Age, BMI_WHO, high difficulty – boxplot with Age + BMI_WHO + Diabetes\n1. Is there a correlation between the age of diabetes diagnosis and the BMI?\n1. Are those with diabetes more likely to have a higher BMI the older they are? Compare it to those without diabetes.\n1. What’s the level of physical activity of children with diabetes? What do you notice about the data? (Don't look at the variable defitions before doing this one.)\n1. Is the number of hours of computer/gaming per day associated with diabetes? Is this true for all ages?\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Depression Questions\n\n1. How is the `Depressed` Variable defined?\n2. When was the data collected? \n3.
